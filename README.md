## Description

Image standardization is used to transforms the pixel values of an image to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
This is accompished by finding the mean and standard deviation of all pixels in the image, subtracting the mean and dividing
by the standard deviation for each pixel.

    standardized_image = (pixel_value - image_mean) / image_std_dev

Standardizing the images is useful for Machine Learning, especially for Neural Networks. It can help speed the convergence
of parameters to a global optimum by making all features have similar ranges. Smaller values also tend to help in speeding
the convergence.

The code in this repository uses a subset of the MNIST dataset. It will go through all images in the directory and save
the standardized image to the ./standard folder using the same name as the original file with an std appended to the
end of the name (before the .)

## Supported OSes

Linux, Windows

## Supported CPU Architecture

x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l

## CUDA APIs involved

## Dependencies needed to build/run
[FreeImage](../../README.md#freeimage), [NPP](../../README.md#npp)

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 11.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
Make sure the dependencies mentioned in [Dependencies]() section above are installed.

## Build and Run

### Windows
The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format:
```
*_vs<version>.sln - for Visual Studio <version>
```
Each individual sample has its own set of solution files in its directory:

To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used.
> **Note:** Some samples require that the Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010 or newer) be installed and that the VC++ directory paths are properly set up (**Tools > Options...**). Check DirectX Dependencies section for details."

### Linux
The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ make
```
The samples makefiles can take advantage of certain options:
*  **TARGET_ARCH=<arch>** - cross-compile targeting a specific architecture. Allowed architectures are x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l.
    By default, TARGET_ARCH is set to HOST_ARCH. On a x86_64 machine, not setting TARGET_ARCH is the equivalent of setting TARGET_ARCH=x86_64.<br/>
`$ make TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=ppc64le` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=armv7l` <br/>
    See [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#cross-samples) for more details.
*   **dbg=1** - build with debug symbols
    ```
    $ make dbg=1
    ```
*   **SMS="A B ..."** - override the SM architectures for which the sample will be built, where `"A B ..."` is a space-delimited list of SM architectures. For example, to generate SASS for SM 50 and SM 60, use `SMS="50 60"`.
    ```
    $ make SMS="50 60"
    ```
